# Syntax.js - Change Log:

## Version 0.2.0:
- Added a border around the code container (uses root variables for easy changing).
- Increased the padding slightly for the "Copy" button.
- Added a background color the code syntax container (next to the numbers) and added a border radius.
- Added new public function "addLanguage()", which will add a new language to the library and will auto-render DOM elements found for that language.
- Added all missing keywords for the built-in language "JavaScript".
